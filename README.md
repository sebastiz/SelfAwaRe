## A methodology for the routine improvement of endoscopic practice

Endoscopy is carried out around the world thousands of times a day. It is extremely important that the performance of endoscopy is always excellent and that this excellence is standardised across all endoscopists. Although there are methods to measure performance of individual endoscopists, these often lack mechanisms to provide in-depth areas of improvement. Furthermore the lack of ability in most centres to associate endoscopic images with the results of biopsies means that lesion recognition improvement is outside of the normal workflow for most endoscopists.

This package provides a methodology for the routine collection of performance data for individual endoscopists as well as methods for the association of endoscopy images from common endoscopy software types, with the pathology reports from tissue taken at individual endoscopies. It also demonstrates methods to further build tools using the pathology-endoscopy image outputs, for example, building endoscopy images atlases
